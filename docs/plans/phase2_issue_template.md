# Phase 2: Data Pipeline (Weeks 3-4)

## Overview
Implement the job data pipeline including API integration, NLP processing, and search indexing.

## Tasks
1. Integrate JSearch API for job data fetching
2. Implement job data model
3. Create Python service for NLP processing
4. Set up data ingestion pipeline
5. Configure Meilisearch indexing
6. Implement job data CRUD operations
7. Set up testing framework with Pytest
8. Achieve 100% test coverage for implemented features

## Technology Stack
- JSearch API for job data
- Python FastAPI for NLP service
- Transformers (Hugging Face) for NER
- Meilisearch for indexing
- Pytest for testing

## Deliverables
- Working job data ingestion pipeline
- NLP processing service for skill extraction
- Meilisearch integration
- Job data CRUD operations
- Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage
- Documentation for implemented features
