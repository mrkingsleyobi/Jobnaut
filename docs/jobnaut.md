## 7\. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Product Overview

**Product Name:** JobNaut – AI-Powered Job Market Navigator.

**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)

**Introduction:** JobNaut is a web application that combines real-time job market data with artificial intelligence to help users navigate their career paths. The MVP will focus on providing personalized job recommendations, skill gap analysis, and an AI chatbot for career advice. This PRD outlines the features, requirements, and implementation plan for JobNaut’s first release.

**Objectives:**

*   Enable users to discover relevant job opportunities efficiently.
*   Provide insights into in-demand skills and career trends.
*   Offer personalized recommendations to help users upskill or target their job search.
*   Demonstrate a scalable architecture that integrates AI models and external data sources.

### User Stories

*   **Job Seeker Alice:** Alice is a mid-level software developer looking for her next job. She wants to find roles that match her skills and also get guidance on what skills to learn next. With JobNaut, Alice can create a profile with her skills and experience. The app will recommend jobs that fit her profile and alert her to new postings. She can ask the AI coach, “I want to move into DevOps – what should I focus on?” and get a helpful answer. Alice can also input her resume and have the AI suggest improvements or highlight missing skills. This helps her feel more confident and prepared in her job search.
*   **Career Explorer Bob:** Bob is considering a career change into data science but isn’t sure where to start. On JobNaut, Bob can browse the “Career Insights” section to see what skills are most demanded for data science roles globally. He uses the AI chatbot to ask, “What are the typical steps to become a data scientist?” The chatbot provides a step-by-step guide and suggests some entry-level data science jobs to look at. Bob also uses the job search to filter for “Entry-level Data Science” positions and is able to see a curated list of opportunities. This gives him a clear roadmap and concrete opportunities to pursue.
*   **Employer/Recruiter Carol:** Carol is a recruiter who wants to understand the talent pool for a new role her company is hiring for (say, “AI Engineer”). She logs into JobNaut (we have a separate mode for recruiters or she uses the public dashboard) and looks at the “Skill Trends” report. She sees which skills are most common among AI Engineer applicants and which are rare. She uses the AI assistant to ask, “What key skills should we highlight in our job posting to attract top AI talent?” The AI provides a list of in-demand skills and maybe some phrasing tips. Carol then uses the job posting feature to publish her job on JobNaut, knowing that it will be seen by relevant candidates. (Note: The recruiter use-case might be out of scope for MVP but is a potential future expansion.)

### Functional Requirements

**User Authentication & Profiles:**

*   Users can sign up and log in using email or social accounts (Google/GitHub). (Authentication provided by Clerk/Auth.js.)
*   Upon sign-up, users create a profile including their name, location, experience level, and a list of skills. They can also optionally upload or input their resume for further analysis.
*   User profiles are stored in the database and can be edited at any time. The profile data is used to personalize job recommendations and AI interactions.

**Job Search & Recommendations:**

*   **Job Aggregation:** The system will aggregate job listings from multiple sources (e.g., a public jobs API like JSearch by RapidAPI, GitHub Jobs, and potentially direct scrapes of company career pages). At least 10,000+ job listings will be ingested and updated regularly (daily or weekly) to ensure freshness.
*   **Search Interface:** A search bar allows users to search jobs by keywords (skills, job titles) and filter by location, remote availability, experience level, etc. Search results are displayed in real-time as the user types, thanks to the integrated `agentic-search` library. Each result shows the job title, company, location, and a snippet of the description.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on the user’s profile and activity, the app will show a “Recommended Jobs” section on the dashboard. The recommendation algorithm considers the user’s skills (matching them to job requirements), their location preferences, and jobs that are trending in their field. For example, if a user has skills in Python and is interested in data roles, the system will highlight new data analyst or data engineer jobs. This feature uses the text classification and NER models to match user skills to job requirements.
*   **Job Details & Save Feature:** Users can click on a job to see full details (description, requirements, application link). They can save jobs to a “Saved Jobs” list for later review. Saved jobs are stored in the user’s profile. The system will also allow users to note why they saved a job or track their application status for each saved job.

**Skill Insights & Analytics:**

*   **Skill Demand Trends:** The app will display statistics on in-demand skills. For example, a chart showing the top 10 most mentioned skills in job postings across all listings or within a specific field. This is generated by analyzing the aggregated job data with the NLP models (extracting skill entities and counting frequencies). Users can filter these trends by region or industry to see localized insights.
*   **Salary and Market Trends:** Where available (some job postings include salary ranges or we use external data), the app will show average salary ranges for popular roles in major locations. Users can query this data via the chatbot (e.g., “What’s the average salary for a frontend developer in Berlin?”) and get an answer. We’ll also include some static infographics or a blog-style section discussing market trends (e.g., “Full Stack Developers in 2025: Trends and Projections” referencing sources like Naukri.com’s report ).
*   **User Skill Gap Analysis:** For logged-in users, JobNaut will provide a “Skill Gap Analysis” report. The AI will compare the skills listed in the user’s profile/resume against the skills required in the jobs they are interested in. It will then suggest which skills they might be missing or could strengthen. For instance, if a user wants to apply for senior roles but lacks experience with certain tools commonly asked for, the system will highlight that. This feature uses the NER model on the user’s data and on target job descriptions, then uses a text generation model to formulate the suggestion in natural language.

**AI Career Coach (Chatbot):**

*   **Conversational Interface:** A chat interface (powered by a Hugging Face conversational model) will be available on the dashboard. Users can type questions or prompts and get AI-generated responses. The chatbot will be fine-tuned or instructed to specialize in career advice and job search topics.
*   **Knowledge Integration:** The chatbot will have access to certain knowledge sources: the user’s profile data (with permission), the aggregated job data (via the Table QA model for factual questions), and general career advice knowledge (from a fine-tuned dataset or prompt engineering). This means if a user asks, “Based on my profile, what kind of jobs should I look for?”, the bot can respond with personalized suggestions. If they ask a factual question like “What does a DevOps engineer do?”, the bot can provide a general answer, and if available, even reference a job description snippet.
*   **Guidance and Motivation:** Beyond Q&A, the chatbot can engage in more open-ended coaching. For example, a user might say, “I’m feeling stuck in my career, can you help?” The AI can ask clarifying questions or provide motivational tips and steps. The tone will be supportive and encouraging. This adds a personal touch to the application, making users feel like they have a mentor.
*   **Limitations and Safety:** The chatbot’s responses will be moderated to avoid inappropriate content. If it doesn’t know an answer, it should say so or offer to look up relevant information. We’ll implement a feedback mechanism where users can rate the helpfulness of the AI’s answers, which we can use to further improve the model.

**Additional Features:**

*   **Job Application Assistant:** (Stretch goal) Users can input a job description they’re interested in, and the app will generate a tailored cover letter or resume bullet points highlighting their relevant experience. This uses the text generation model fine-tuned on resumes/cover letters. The user can then copy or download this draft.
*   **Notifications:** (Stretch goal) Users can opt-in to email or in-app notifications for new job recommendations, skill trend updates, or if a saved job’s status changes (e.g., it’s no longer available). This requires setting up a notification service and possibly a cron job to check for updates daily.

### Technical Requirements

**Architecture:** The system will follow a **microservices-like architecture** for clarity, even if initially deployed monolithically. Key components include:

*   **Frontend Web App (Nuxt 3):** Serves the user interface. It will make API calls to the backend and also directly use the `agentic-search` library for client-side search requests. The Nuxt app will handle routing (e.g., /dashboard, /jobs, /profile) and render dynamic content. Server-side rendering will be used for pages like blog posts or public stats to improve SEO.
*   **Backend API (tRPC + Node.js):** Provides data to the frontend. It exposes procedures for fetching user data, jobs, etc. It also acts as a gateway to other services. For example, when the frontend needs AI results, it calls a tRPC endpoint which then communicates with the AI service.
*   **AI Service (Python):** A separate service (could be a Python FastAPI server or a set of cloud functions) that encapsulates the Hugging Face model logic. It will have endpoints for tasks like “analyze resume”, “get chatbot response”, “classify job”, etc. This service uses the Transformers library and LangChain. We might containerize this service for scalability.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma):** Stores user accounts, profiles, saved jobs, and possibly precomputed data like skill counts. Prisma will be used from both the Node.js backend (for user data) and potentially the Python service (if it needs to log results or access user data). We’ll ensure database connection pooling and optimize queries for performance (indexing on user IDs, job IDs, etc.).
*   **Search Index (Meilisearch):** We will run a Meilisearch instance that is populated with job data. The backend or a separate script will update this index whenever new jobs are ingested. The `agentic-search` library on the frontend will connect to Meilisearch’s API to perform searches. Meilisearch is chosen for its speed and ease of integration with TypeScript.
*   **MCP Server (`qudag-mcp`):** We will integrate the `qudag-mcp` crate to run an MCP server as part of our backend or AI service. This server will manage context for the AI models. For instance, when the chatbot agent wants to retrieve a user’s profile, it will query the MCP server which in turn fetches it from the database with proper authentication. The MCP server will also handle tool execution requests from the AI (like “search jobs for X”) by invoking the appropriate function (e.g., calling the search index). By using MCP, we ensure all AI actions are logged and secure.

**APIs and Integrations:**

*   **Job Data API:** We will use a third-party job API (such as JSearch by RapidAPI) to fetch job listings. We’ll need to handle API rate limits and possibly schedule periodic fetches (cron jobs) to keep the database updated. We’ll also consider scraping some sites if needed, but with respect to their terms of service.
*   **Hugging Face Inference API:** For initial development, we might use Hugging Face’s hosted inference API for the models to simplify setup. However, for better performance and cost control, we plan to download and run key models locally or on our own servers (especially if we fine-tune any models). We’ll use the `transformers` library to load models like `bert-base-uncased` for NER, `blenderbot-400M` for chat, etc., possibly on a GPU-enabled server for faster inference.
*   **External Skills Data:** We might integrate an API or dataset that lists common skills and their categories (to help normalize skills – e.g., knowing that “Python” and “Python3” refer to the same skill). One option is the Skills API by Apitarget or using an open dataset of skills.
*   **Geocoding API:** To handle location filters smartly (like allowing “remote” or understanding city vs. country), we can use a geocoding service (e.g., OpenStreetMap Nominatim or Google Maps Geocoding) to standardize location inputs and enable searches within a radius.

**Scalability:**

*   The system should be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users on the frontend during peak times (e.g., evening hours when many users might be browsing jobs). We’ll optimize the frontend with code splitting (Nuxt does this by default) and caching of static assets. On the backend, we’ll ensure the Node.js server is clustered to utilize multiple CPU cores.
*   For the AI service, if it becomes a bottleneck (since model inference can be slow), we can scale it horizontally by adding more instances behind a load balancer. We might also prioritize which AI features are most used and optimize those first (for example, if the chatbot is hit frequently, we might run that model on a dedicated GPU server).
*   Database queries will be optimized with indexes (for example, an index on `job.title` and `job.skills` for quick lookups, and on `user.id` for profile retrieval). We’ll also consider implementing caching for read-heavy data – e.g., the top skills list rarely changes, so we can cache it and regenerate daily.
*   The architecture is designed such that each component can be scaled independently. For instance, the search index can run on a separate server, and the AI service can be containerized and deployed on Kubernetes or serverless functions if needed. This modularity is important for future scalability beyond the MVP.

**Security:**

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** All user-specific endpoints require a valid JWT token. We’ll use role-based access if needed (for example, an admin role to manage the system, or a recruiter role in future versions). The MCP server will also check that an AI agent has permission to access a certain resource (e.g., only the user’s own data) before providing it.
*   **Data Privacy:** User data (especially resumes) will be stored securely. We will comply with privacy regulations like GDPR – users can request to delete their data. Resumes or any sensitive text will be encrypted at rest if possible. Since we use AI models, we have to be cautious: we’ll avoid sending sensitive user data to third-party APIs unless necessary (for instance, we won’t send a user’s resume to an external API; any processing will be done on our servers or locally).
*   **Input Sanitization:** We’ll sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS or SQL injection. The chatbot’s inputs will also be sanitized to avoid any code injection or abuse. We might filter out certain content (like hate speech) from being sent to the AI or from being output by the AI.
*   **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse, we’ll implement rate limiting on API endpoints. For example, limit how often a user can call the AI chat endpoint (to prevent spamming or someone using our service as a free chatbot for other purposes). We can use Express Rate Limit or similar middleware for this.
*   **Secure Dependencies:** We’ll regularly update our libraries (Nuxt, tRPC, Prisma, etc.) to patch security vulnerabilities. Using tools like Dependabot to alert on outdated dependencies will be part of our process. Also, since we’re using third-party libraries like those from ruvnet, we’ll review their security practices and ensure they don’t introduce risks.

**Performance:**

*   Page load times should be under 2 seconds for the main pages (Nuxt’s SSR will help with initial load). We’ll leverage browser caching for static assets and use a CDN for images or large files.
*   API response times: most tRPC queries should respond in <500ms. Database queries will be optimized, and if any query is slow, we’ll add indexes or consider caching the result. For the AI endpoints, responses might be slower (a few seconds for a complex chatbot answer), so we’ll implement asynchronous handling – the frontend can show a loading indicator, and we might even stream the chatbot’s response as it’s generated for a smoother experience.
*   We’ll set up logging and monitoring (using tools like Winston or Bunyan for logs, and possibly integrating with New Relic/Datadog as mentioned earlier) to keep an eye on performance metrics. If certain parts degrade, we’ll address them proactively (for example, if the job aggregation takes too long, we might offload it to a background job so it doesn’t block the main server).

### Data Requirements

**Data Sources:**

*   **Job Listings:** As mentioned, primarily from an API like JSearch. We need fields such as job title, company name, location, job description, posted date, application link, and ideally salary range. We will store a subset of this data in our DB for quick access, but also keep references to the source.
*   **User Data:** User profiles (name, email, hashed password, skills, resume text if provided, saved jobs list, etc.). We’ll also store session tokens for security. We might store anonymized usage data (e.g., which jobs were clicked) to improve recommendations, but only in aggregate form if used for model training.
*   **Skill Data:** We will maintain a list of normalized skills (maybe a table of skill names and categories). This can be built from the job data (extracting all unique skills via NER and then deduplicating variations). We’ll also use this to suggest skills to users (autocomplete when they add skills to their profile).
*   **AI Model Data:** The models themselves (like the BERT model weights) are not stored in our DB but on disk or in cloud storage. We will need sufficient storage (a few GBs) to download model files. We might also have a small dataset for fine-tuning if we decide to fine-tune a model on, say, a corpus of resumes or interview questions.

**Data Processing:**

*   When new jobs are ingested, they go through an NLP pipeline: the title and description are processed by the text classification model to assign a role/category, and by the NER model to extract skills and other entities (like years of experience mentioned). All this processed info (categories, list of skills, maybe seniority level) is stored alongside the job in the DB to enable fast queries (instead of running NER every time a user searches).
*   User resumes, if provided, will be processed by the NER model to auto-fill their skill list (with user confirmation). This saves the user time in entering skills manually.
*   The AI chatbot will have a limited memory per session (we won’t remember every conversation indefinitely to respect privacy). However, we might log conversation summaries for improvement purposes (with user opt-out). Any logs will be stored securely and not used to identify individuals.

### User Interface & UX (Wireframes)

**Dashboard:** Upon login, the user sees a dashboard with an overview of their job search progress. It includes sections for “Recommended Jobs” (a list of job cards), “Your Saved Jobs” (quick links to saved items), and a sidebar with the AI chatbot interface. There’s also a prominent search bar at the top.

**Job Search Results:** When a user searches or browses jobs, they get a list view with filters on the side. Each job card shows key info. Users can click “Save” on any job to add it to their list. There’s also an option to “View Details” which opens the full job page.

**Job Details Page:** This page shows the complete job description, company info, and how to apply. We’ll embed any external application link or provide a form if we allow direct applications through our site (though direct apply might be out of scope initially). We’ll also show a “Skill Match” indicator here – e.g., “This job requires 5 skills, 3 of which you have” as determined by our analysis.

**Profile Page:** Users can edit their profile, see their skill gap report, and upload/update their resume. We’ll display their current skills and perhaps a progress bar or chart showing how their skills compare to the market (e.g., “You have 8 of the top 10 skills for your target role”).

**Chatbot Interface:** A chat window (possibly a persistent sidebar or a modal) where the user and AI messages are displayed. The user types a question and hits send. The AI’s responses might include formatted text, maybe even links or lists. We’ll design the chat to feel friendly – perhaps with a simple avatar for the AI and the ability to ask follow-up questions easily.

**Insights Dashboard (Public):** There will be a public page (no login required) that shows general job market insights – like top skills charts, maybe a map of job hotspots, and some interesting stats (“X new jobs added this week”). This serves as a landing page to attract visitors and also helps with SEO by providing valuable content.

**Mobile Responsiveness:** The UI will be responsive so that users can access JobNaut on tablets and phones. Key features like job search and the chatbot should be fully usable on mobile. We might use a mobile-first approach in design, given many users might browse jobs on their phones.

_(Wireframe sketches would normally be included here to visualize these pages, but due to format constraints, we describe them in detail.)_

### Performance and Scalability

We’ve outlined many performance considerations above. To summarize, our approach includes:

*   Caching frequent queries and precomputing heavy computations (like top skills) offline.
*   Using efficient libraries (e.g., Meilisearch for search, Prisma for optimized DB queries).
*   Horizontal scaling of components that need it (especially the AI service and web server).
*   Monitoring and optimizing continuously. We’ll do load testing (using tools like k6 or Artillery) on the API to simulate multiple users and ensure it can handle the expected load. If any part of the system shows strain, we’ll iterate – for example, adding a reverse proxy cache (Vercel/Netlify edge functions or Cloudflare) for static content, or using a more powerful GPU for the AI models if needed.

### Security and Privacy

In addition to the points in Technical Requirements, we’ll ensure:

*   HTTPS is used everywhere to protect data in transit.
*   We’ll have a clear privacy policy for users, explaining what data we collect and how it’s used (especially regarding AI processing of their data).
*   If we ever decide to use user data to improve our models (beyond the scope of MVP), we’ll get user consent and possibly anonymize the data.
*   Regular security audits: We might run security scanning tools on our code (for vulnerabilities) and penetration testing on the deployed app to catch any issues early.

### Timeline and Milestones

Given the scope, we estimate a development timeline of about 12 weeks for the MVP. Below is a high-level project plan:

*   **Weeks 1–2 (Project Setup & Backend Foundations):** Set up the repository, development environment, and core backend services. Implement user authentication and basic user profile CRUD using tRPC and Prisma. Configure the database schema (users, jobs, saved\_jobs tables). By the end of week 2, we should have a running Node.js server with auth working and the ability to create/update a user profile.
*   **Weeks 3–4 (Job Data Pipeline):** Integrate the job API and write scripts to fetch and store job data. Implement the NLP processing for jobs (classification and NER) in the Python service. Populate the database and search index with initial job data. At the end of week 4, we should have a few thousand jobs in the system and be able to retrieve them via the backend API.
*   **Weeks 5–6 (Frontend Development & Search):** Develop the Nuxt 3 frontend. Create the home page, search UI, and job listing components. Connect the frontend to the tRPC backend for fetching jobs and to Meilisearch for search. By week 6, users should be able to search and see job results in the UI, and click through to job details.
*   **Weeks 7–8 (AI Chatbot & Personalization):** Focus on the AI features. Set up the chatbot interface on the frontend. Implement the chatbot backend logic: the Node.js server will call the Python AI service which uses a conversational model to generate responses. Add the logic for personalized recommendations (a simple algorithm initially, like filtering jobs by user’s skills). Also implement the skill gap analysis: run the NER on the user’s resume (if provided) and compare to job skills. By week 8, the core AI features should be functional – a user can chat with the bot and get basic recommendations, and see some insight like missing skills.
*   **Weeks 9–10 (Polish & Testing):** Refine the user experience. Add the “Saved Jobs” functionality, notifications if planned, and any remaining features (like cover letter generator if we include it). Perform thorough testing: unit tests for backend logic, integration tests for API endpoints, and user testing for the UI. Fix bugs and improve the AI responses based on test feedback. Set up monitoring and logging in the staging environment. Prepare the deployment infrastructure (configure Vercel, Render, etc., and ensure environment variables/secrets are set).
*   **Weeks 11–12 (Deployment & Launch):** Deploy the application to production. Conduct a final round of testing on the live environment. Implement any last-minute optimizations for performance or security. Prepare marketing materials and the LinkedIn posts. Then launch JobNaut to the public (or at least make it available for a beta group). After launch, monitor usage and collect initial user feedback to plan for future iterations.

This timeline is ambitious but feasible for a solo developer with full-time focus. It may slip if any AI integration proves more complex than expected (for example, if the chatbot’s accuracy is poor and requires extensive fine-tuning). We will remain agile – if some features are taking too long, we can push them to a post-MVP release to ensure we deliver a working product in 3 months.

### Conclusion

JobNaut’s PRD outlines a comprehensive plan to build a valuable, cutting-edge application. By following these requirements, we aim to create a product that not only meets user needs but also showcases advanced architecture and AI integration. The project will be guided by this document, ensuring that all stakeholders (in this case, primarily you as the developer) have a clear vision of what to build and why. With careful execution, JobNaut will launch as a strong MVP, ready to delight users and strengthen your portfolio.
