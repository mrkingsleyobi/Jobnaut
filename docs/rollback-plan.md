# JobNaut Rollback Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for rolling back JobNaut deployments in case of issues or failures. The rollback plan covers both the backend API service and frontend web application.

## Prerequisites

Before executing a rollback, ensure you have:

1. Access to the production deployment environment
2. Backup of the previous working version
3. Database backup from before the deployment
4. Access to deployment logs and monitoring systems
5. List of environment variables and configuration settings

## Rollback Scenarios

### 1. Application Code Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Application crashes or fails to start
- Critical functionality is broken
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. **Identify the Issue:**
   - Check application logs for error messages
   - Monitor health check endpoints
   - Review recent changes and deployments

2. **Stop Current Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # For Docker deployments
   docker-compose down

   # For direct deployments
   # Stop the application processes
   ```

3. **Restore Previous Version:**
   ```bash
   # If using version control
   git checkout <previous_stable_commit>

   # If using deployment artifacts
   # Restore the previous version files
   ```

4. **Restore Database (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   pg_restore -d jobnaut_prod jobnaut_backup_<timestamp>.sql
   ```

5. **Re-deploy Previous Version:**
   ```bash
   # For Docker deployments
   docker-compose up -d

   # For direct deployments
   npm start
   ```

6. **Verify Rollback:**
   - Check health check endpoints
   - Test critical functionality
   - Monitor application logs
   - Verify user access

### 2. Database Migration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Database connection errors
- Data integrity issues
- Query failures
- Missing or corrupted data

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. **Stop Application:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the application to prevent further database changes
   docker-compose stop backend
   ```

2. **Identify Failed Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Check migration status
   npx prisma migrate status
   ```

3. **Rollback Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Rollback the specific migration
   npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back "<migration_name>"

   # Or reset to previous state
   npx prisma migrate reset
   ```

4. **Restore Database from Backup:**
   ```bash
   # If rollback is not sufficient, restore from backup
   pg_restore -d jobnaut_prod jobnaut_backup_<timestamp>.sql
   ```

5. **Re-deploy Application:**
   ```bash
   # Re-deploy the previous version
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Verify Database Integrity:**
   - Test database connections
   - Verify data integrity
   - Check application functionality

### 3. Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Authentication failures
- Environment-specific errors
- Integration failures
- Security configuration issues

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. **Identify Configuration Issue:**
   - Check application logs for configuration errors
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test external integrations

2. **Restore Previous Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Restore previous environment file
   cp .env.production.backup .env.production

   # Or revert configuration changes
   git checkout <previous_commit> -- .env.production
   ```

3. **Restart Application:**
   ```bash
   # Restart with correct configuration
   docker-compose restart
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration:**
   - Test authentication
   - Verify external integrations
   - Check security settings

## Emergency Rollback Procedure

In case of critical system failure:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Notify team and stakeholders
   - Document the issue and timeline
   - Stop all new deployments

2. **System Restoration:**
   - Restore from the most recent stable backup
   - Revert to the last known good deployment
   - Ensure all services are running correctly

3. **Verification:**
   - Test all critical user flows
   - Verify data integrity
   - Confirm system stability

4. **Communication:**
   - Update stakeholders on rollback status
   - Provide estimated time for service restoration
   - Document lessons learned

## Rollback Testing

Regularly test rollback procedures:

1. **Monthly Rollback Drills:**
   - Simulate deployment failure scenarios
   - Test rollback procedures in staging environment
   - Document and improve procedures

2. **Post-Deployment Validation:**
   - Verify rollback capability after each deployment
   - Ensure backup systems are functioning
   - Update rollback documentation

## Monitoring During Rollback

During rollback execution, monitor:

1. **Application Health:**
   - Health check endpoint responses
   - Error rates and log messages
   - Performance metrics

2. **Database Status:**
   - Connection availability
   - Query performance
   - Data integrity

3. **User Impact:**
   - Service availability
   - User experience
   - Support ticket volume

## Communication Plan

During rollback execution:

1. **Internal Communication:**
   - Keep development team informed
   - Update project managers and stakeholders
   - Document rollback progress

2. **External Communication:**
   - Notify users of service disruption
   - Provide estimated restoration time
   - Update status page if available

## Post-Rollback Actions

After successful rollback:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identify cause of deployment failure
   - Document findings and solutions
   - Update deployment procedures

2. **System Stability:**
   - Monitor for any residual issues
   - Verify all services are functioning
   - Confirm data integrity

3. **Process Improvement:**
   - Update rollback documentation
   - Improve deployment testing
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting
